Digital Portraits: Creating expressive characters in Blender – Elodie Anglade & Kylan Luginbühl

In this workshop, participants will create expressive 3D characters using Blender, exploring techniques for stylized digital portraits and playful, visually rich designs. The session emphasizes experimentation and translating everyday life into digital spaces, combining technical skills with creative storytelling.

Elodie Anglade and Kylan Luginbühl work with 3D animation, interactive technologies, and hybrid realities to craft playful and experimental digital experiences. Their practice focuses on small, intimate ideas that grow into stylized, narrative-driven projects.

Participants should bring a laptop with Blender 5.0 installed and be comfortable with the Blender interface.
