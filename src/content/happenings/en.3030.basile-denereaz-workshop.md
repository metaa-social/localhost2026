Introduction to modular synthesis with VCV Rack – Basil Denereaz

This workshop introduces modular synthesis using VCV Rack, guiding participants through hands-on sound design and experimental signal routing. It emphasizes exploration, curiosity, and creative experimentation to develop unique sonic textures and compositions.

Basil Denereaz is an electronic music producer with over 13 years of experience, specializing in modular synthesis. He creates original soundtracks for multimedia projects, interactive experiences, and installations, combining hardware and software tools to explore complex sonic landscapes.

Participants should bring a laptop with wired headphones, a free VCV Rack account, and VCV Rack 2 installed. Basic computer skills are required; prior knowledge of sound synthesis is a plus but not mandatory.
