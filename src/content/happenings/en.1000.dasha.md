Dasha Ilina is a Russian technocritical artist based in Paris. She employs low-tech and DIY approaches to question, document, and challenge the mythology surrounding technology, ultimately revealing what it tells us about the world. 

Her practice engages the public in order to facilitate a space for the development of critical thought regarding social imperatives for care, privacy in the digital age, and the reflexive contemporary urge to turn to technology for answers.
