Sophie Conus is a Swiss sound and visual artist, member of the LIMBO collective based at Zabriskie in Geneva.

Working under the alias Softness, she performs live using field recordings, voice, and flute textures processed through effects pedals, drawing on Ambient, Drone, and Trance influences. Her installations combine sculptures, found objects, and soundscapes to explore tensions between public and private space, industrial and organic materials, and collective memory and childhood recollection. She recently composed the soundtrack for the documentary Les Chasseresses.
