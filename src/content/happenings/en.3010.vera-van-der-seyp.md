Break the Loop – Vera van de Seyp

In this workshop, you will create a browser-based computational design tool to generate typographic animations and printed posters. The session explores the web browser as a design interface through iterative, code-driven sketching that balances structure and experimentation.

Vera van de Seyp is a computational designer and educator working at the intersection of graphic design and code, focusing on generative systems, experimental typography, and custom creative tools.

Participants should bring a laptop with a code editor and have a basic understanding of JavaScript.
