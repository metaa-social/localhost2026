Mathilde Périat and Juliette Cuénoud share a common love for moving images and other graphic vibrations. As image hunters and 'cinegenic' lovers, it was a natural fit for them to collaborate on a project that is unique, experimental, and visually rhythmic.

Pixelle Panthère is an analog visual experience created using vintage electronic equipment. Through their machines, spectators travel through the pixels of another era. All created images are improvised and generated live on the spot, tailored to accompany concerts, performances, and other festivities. The goal is to offer a visual medium for watching sounds, listening to images, and letting oneself be carried away by the spectacle.
