Pauric Freeman is a multidisciplinary artist from Ireland working across audiovisual performance and installation.

He develops custom tools to generate real-time compositions from live instrumental data.

His performances unfold as structures of dense harmony and chaotic rhythms, where sound and image operate as interdependent systems, distorting and reconfiguring through permutations.
