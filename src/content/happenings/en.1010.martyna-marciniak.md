Martyna Marciniak is a Polish, Berlin-based artist, researcher, and 3D designer whose work explores the intersection of visual storytelling, media theory, and systemic violence. Utilizing animation, film, and speculative fiction, she investigates technological biases and human rights abuses, bridging the gap between aesthetics and law.

She has collaborated with Forensic Architecture, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, and co-founded the Border Emergency Collective. A former resident at Akademie Schloss Solitude and the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation, her work has been exhibited at Ars Electronica, Copenhagen Contemporary, and the Warsaw Biennale.
